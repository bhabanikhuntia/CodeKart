            <div class="product_title">ATHRAW</div>
            <div class="product_description">Atharw is one of the initiatives of CodeKart.
              It is the edu-tech platform for providing the finest education based upon both
              technical as well as non-technical domains. The name Atharw has come from one of our Veda i.e. Atharva Veda in which the procedures of day to day life is clearly mentioned. The core values of Atharw has come from Bhagavad Gita i.e. 'Purity', 'Honesty' & 'Dedication'. Being the members of Atharw, we are proud to follow our core values which always motivate us to spread purity through our contents, honestly treat our students and give our 100% dedication which will reflect on our student's career. When students are going to take any of the courses from any platform one thing comes to their mind is whether that course or training is helpful for their career or not and can they get good opportunities to achieve their goal. In the teenage years or after graduation the state of mind of the students is always variable. They can not decide which career path they have to choose and which path gives them satisfaction. As a result they join any field and after some years they get frustrated. In Atharw we don't tell students to join this training, it will make your career good or choose that training that will give you a high package. We first keep ourselves in their place, try to understand their area of interest, their dedication level and their aim of life and then we show them the possibilities and path to get their ultimate goal. In the initial days we have started from varieties of technical training which can make the students industry ready as per the current scenario. Very soon we are going to help students of non-technical background who are preparing for non-technical jobs, students of schools and colleges. Our main motto is to provide quality education with the help of technology because
              we believe that "Technology with education is for everyone"</div>

                <div class="product_description">Everyday many people are facing so many difficulties and searching for help, but are not able to get help in time. Many poor people are there who are purely dependent upon the Government to get their problems solved. But every time Govt. is not able to reach them in time. In that particular time some NGOs or other communities are coming forward and trying to help those helpless people. Those NGOs always want to help people as much as they can, but sometimes they are not also able to reach the poor peoples. To decrease the distance between NGOs or other organizations and the needy people Stand4all is providing them a platform. By using this platform all the NGOs and other organizations who really want to help people can register themselves and share their profiles. Also all the poor as well as needy people can register themselves in this platform and can directly seek help as per their requirement. As Stand4all is the platform only made to help the people who will ask for help, it is not taking any monetary benefit from any parties like organizations or the helpless peoples.</div>
